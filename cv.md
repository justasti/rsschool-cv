## Hello!
My name is Justas Tireviƒçius and I'm looking forward to be a programmer. At least I really hope I could be one day :)
Becoming a code writing nerd has been a small dream of mine since as long as I can remember. Sadly - unfulfilled for a lot of reasons. However, I'm not writing this to cry about it. I've finally got myself together and started chasing after this long dream of mine!

**Little bit about myself**

Currently I'm 27 years old, originally coming from small town in Lithuanian seaside - Garg≈ædai, though after seeking for an academic background I moved and stayed in the temporary capital of Lithuania - Kaunas. After getting professional bachelor degree in finances I've since been working as an economist in a small company. After working there for almost 6 years it came clear to me, that unfortunately that is not the right specialty for me. One thing led to another and here I am - taking full-stack programming course led by Lithuanian company "CodeAcademy", just now entered Rolling Scopes Schools' programming course and... how can we forget the good old Udemy? Of course, a few extra courses didn't hurt anyone :).
Since I haven't got any real experience in programming, I'm unable to prove how good I am (or will be, I promise!), however, it is my word - I will learn, and I will do it fast! Whatever task I'm given - I will do it. I love diving deep into problems which at first glance are impossible. The worst thing is - if I can't wrap my head around it.... I have to! Sometimes I would stare at a computer screen, my phone, paper sheet or etc. for hours - but I will get a solution by any means necessary.

If you're still reading - I think I got your attention!
Hopefully I could be a part of your team and help solving the problems you have (and you also could help me fulfill this dream of mine üòâ), so please hit me up:
